## Inspiration
People are involved in the stock markets and social media more than ever. That's why I created a resource that fuses both worlds to provide investors with information that presents the market with the sentiment from social media.

## What it does
My web app presents social media sentiment, most popular news, tweets, and financial information to the user in order to make more informed decisions about investing in stocks and cryptocurrency.

## How I built it
My project uses gatsby.js and react for the front-end and node.js for the back-end. I utilized the Twitter API for sourcing popular tweets and Finnhub API for general stock and crypto information. My web app runs on Google Firebase Hosting, while my database runs on Firestore. I run the back-end on Google Functions in order to periodically update my database and run search queries.

## Challenges I ran into
I had some issues displaying the historical stock info chart in react and getting tweets that I wanted from Twitter. With enough time, patience, and Sprites, we have persevered through these challenges and implemented all of the features I had in mind for my minimum viable product.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I take pride in building my front-end from scratch and creating my project in a very limited amount of time, with a rather limited knowledge of react.

## What I learned
This project was a great learning experience, especially on the front-end. Implementing the historical data chart involved plenty of problem-solving in react which turned out to be a great learning moment. On the back-end, I polished up my Google Firebase knowledge and skills for deploying apps and managing databases.

## What's next for CrowdAdvisor
This is just the beginning. I plan to implement many more features such as sentiment analysis and news from other social media platforms, beautifying my front-end for that modern look, and adding more stock and crypto information to my dashboard.
